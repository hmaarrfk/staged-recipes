  summary: "(CDT) Development tools for programs to obtain generic access to USB devices"
  description: |
    libusb is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices. It is intended to be
    used by developers to facilitate the production of applications that communicate with
    USB hardware.

    It is portable: Using a single cross-platform API, it provides access to USB devices
    on Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, OpenBSD, etc.

    It is user-mode: No special privilege or elevation is required for the application to
    communicate with a device.

    It is version-agnostic: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to 3.1 (latest), are
    supported.
